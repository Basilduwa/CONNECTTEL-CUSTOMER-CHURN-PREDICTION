## Company Overview 
ConnectTel is a global telecommunications leader, offering innovative and dependable voice,
data, and Internet services to both individuals and businesses.
With a strong commitment to customers and modern technology,
ConnectTel is reshaping the industry, empowering users worldwide to remain connected and flourish in the digital age.

## Problem of the project
Customer churn poses a significant risk to its long-term business sustainability and expansion. 
The company's existing strategies for retaining customers lack accuracy and effectiveness, leading to the loss of valuable customers to competitors.

## Aim of the project


## ADVANTAGES OF THE PREDICTION
-Minimize customer attrition.
-Strengthen customer loyalty.
-Maintain a competitive advantage in the telecom industry.

## Data Source
The data was provided by 10alytics. It contains 21 variables and 7043 number of observations.

## Data Preprocessing
Machine learning preprocessing was performed before introducing the machine learning models. 
These processes involved missing values, scaling features, and class imbalance.

## Machine learning models.
This project involves building supervised ML models. The training and testing dataset was split into a ratio of 67:33. 
The classification models used were;
-Logistic regression
-Random Forest
-Decision Tree

## Evaluation Metrics
The performance was evaluated using the following Machine learning models;
-Precision: The proportion of correctly identifying transactions among all transactions classified as Customer Churn.
-Recall: Proportion of correctly identifying customer churn transactions among all actual customer churn
-F1 score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced metric for model evaluation.

## Conclusion:
In this project,  an effective customer churn prediction system using advanced analytics and machine learning techniques was built. 
Three models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree, were developed and evaluated.
 Logistic Regression proved to be the most accurate with an 81.51% accuracy rate, followed by Random Forest at 80.04%, and Decision Tree at 77.63%. 
A detailed classification report provided insights into precision, recall, and F1-score for both churn and non-churn categories. 
Confusion matrices were employed to visualize model performance. 
Overall, this project equips ConnectTel with the means to proactively address customer churn, enhance loyalty, and stay competitive in the telecommunications industry.
